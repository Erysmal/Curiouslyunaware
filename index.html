<p>I have always wanted to be a computer engineer.. apparently that is what I'm aspiring to study in school. 
  But first I need to start somewhere that is how I arrived at web development, well if there's a particular niche in programming 
  i'm willing to explore its blockchain(cryptocurreny) to be precise. 
  For now i'm hoping to become a web developer and hopefully with time I'd become a fullstack developer.</p>
